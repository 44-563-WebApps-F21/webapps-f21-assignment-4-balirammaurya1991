            <p class="speech">PARKER.  Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes—who has called?                
                PARKER.  Lord Darlington, my lady.                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Hesitates for a moment_.]  Show him up—and I’m at
                home to any one who calls.                
                PARKER.  Yes, my lady.
            </p>
            <p class="stage-direction">LADY WINDERMERE.  It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad
                he’s come.                    
                [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]                    
                PARKER.  Lord Darlington,                    
                [_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON _C._]
            </p>
            <p class="stage-direction">LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?
                LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
                hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
                lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.
                LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
                table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
                everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
                present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?
                LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really? LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
                life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
                down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]
                LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
                birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
                front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made foryou.
            </p>
            <p class="stage-direction">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank
                her for your charming visit.  [_Coming down again_.]  And by the way, I
                must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper—he’s that rich young
                Australian people are taking such notice of just at present.  His father
                made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins—most
                palatable, I believe—I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse
                to eat.  But the son is quite interesting.  I think he’s attracted by
                dear Agatha’s clever talk.  Of course, we should be very sorry to lose
                her, but I think that a mother who doesn’t part with a daughter every
                season has no real affection.  We’re coming to-night, dear.  [PARKER
                _opens C. doors_.]  And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of
                town at once, it is the only thing to do.  Good-bye, once more; come,
                Agatha.
