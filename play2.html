        <p class="stage-direction">LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?
            LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
            hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
            lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.
            LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
            table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
            everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
            present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?
            LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really? LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
            life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
            down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]
            LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
            birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
            front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made foryou.

        <p class="stage-direction">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank
            her for your charming visit.  [_Coming down again_.]  And by the way, I
            must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper—he’s that rich young
            Australian people are taking such notice of just at present.  His father
            made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins—most
            palatable, I believe—I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse
            to eat.  But the son is quite interesting.  I think he’s attracted by
            dear Agatha’s clever talk.  Of course, we should be very sorry to lose
            her, but I think that a mother who doesn’t part with a daughter every
            season has no real affection.  We’re coming to-night, dear.  [PARKER
            _opens C. doors_.]  And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of
            town at once, it is the only thing to do.  Good-bye, once more; come,
            Agatha.
